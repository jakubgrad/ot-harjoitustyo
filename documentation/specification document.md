The purpose of the application , i.e. a small textual overview of the application
Users , i.e. information about the different user roles that exist in the system
However, if your application only has one type of user, there is no need. This is likely to be the case with many exercise subjects such as games.
Designed functionalities
Functionalities can be described in French lines in the same way as in the reference project
In the reference project, the functionalities of the core functionality implemented in the basic version, i.e. already "at the beginning of the course", are described in more detail
Further development ideas that expand the basic version are in their own list
You can also make a user interface draft like a reference project , but it is not mandatory.:
I chose my programming language to be `Python`, because I have the most familiarity with it. Other languages I know reasonably well are `Javascript` and `React`, which are naturally not suitable for algorithm oriented applications. I occasionally learn `bash` and `C` though, so I can to a certain extent preview that sort of code, but I would prefer to peer review `Python` only.<br />
