#### Purpose of the application<br />
The application is designed for household owners to estimate their energy consumption and pollution based on the information about their houses and a simple energy model.<br />
#### 👥 Using the application<br />
A user can log in and fill out an assessment of their home, edit it, and view the energy consumption and pollution estimates. <br />
There could possibly exist an admin group who can change the parameters of the model also using the graphical interface (more in further development ideas). <br />

#### UI<br />
A user is welcomed by login/register buttons. If they click register, they're taken to registration. If they choose login, they are presented with the information about their house. If they haven't created it yet, there will be a "Create new house" button, clicking on which a user is taken to an assessment.<br /><br />
